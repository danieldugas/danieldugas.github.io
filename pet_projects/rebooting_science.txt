Rebooting Science

  Imagine you woke up in 0AD, with nothing but epoch-appropriate clothes. How quickly could you get modern technology back?
  Let's skip the first two major issues: language, and survival,
  As a joker, you have an ability to summon an audience with a local leader, king, or aristocrat, once.

  Ideas:
  first, to convince anyone, you need to come up with real practical feats:
  1. the compass - easiest to make, big impact, useful for navigation, war, and more.
  2. gunpowder - saltpeter, charcoal, and sulfur - saltpeter being hardest to find: takes 6 months to make from common ingredients (manure), or must be mined.
  once faith is placed in your potential, and you are given mindshare / actual resources:
  3. hygiene, theory of germs, basic human anatomy
  4. antenna / radio - hard to make, requires copper and a LOT of fine tuning. but insane ROI

I believe this would make a good episodic video series.
For example, a mix of animated story-telling, and real life demonstrations of doability.
